This project requires running the backtester.py file. A GUI application will load prompting the user for input. In the ticker text box, the user must select a valid stock ticker according to the yfinance library. For example, the user may enter 'AAPL' for Apple stock. The user must then enter a quantity of shares in the quantity text box. Fractional shares are permitted. The user must then enter a date in yyyy-mm-dd format in the date text box. The date must be a date the stock market was open for the selected ticker, and the date must be between the previous transaction and the present day. For example, if the first transaction had a date of 2025-02-25, the next transaction's date must be after 2025-02-25 but before today. The first transaction must be after 1900-01-01. The user can then choose to either buy the stock or sell the stock clicking either of the respective buttons. If the user wishes to sell the stock, he must have previously bought it. If the user wishes to buy the stock, he must be able to afford it. The portfolio begins with a $10,000 balance. After creating all the desired transactions, the user may then click the calculate portfolio value button to see how much the value of the portfolio at the present day. The user may then click the visualize portfolio button to see a chart of the portfolio value.
